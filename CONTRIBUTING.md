# Welcome to the contributing guide

Thank you for your interest in this project.

Currently, this project is in a very early state (pre 1.0).
As this is primarily a personal project for now and the project being in a very early state
where dramatic changes can be decided very quickly, contribution is not expected and will likely be rejected.

As soon as the compiler for ion was rewritten in ion and is pretty much stable
a real contributing guide will be written.

You can add this project to your watchlist to be notified.
